Ice Cream Sandwiches Make Me Happy...

I tend to think out of the box. The universe interests me. Time Travel is very possible.

I think of our life here on this planet as a rip in the space time continuum.
A 'glitch'. 

I think chocoloate is in the top 3 pleasures of living.

Music is the language of the universe. It has to be.

I think open source is one of the most awesome concepts in my generation.

Take care and be good. Be kind to your fellow humans. It's all we have.
